Green Gecko was made by a team of 4 including
Gabriel Clark,
Abigail Seibel,
Isaac Kramer,
and Anders Long

The idea behind Green Gecko was a Duo Lingo-esque game that incentivized green transportation
by prompting the user for miles traveled and miles per gallon(mpg) associated with their car,
the app calculated how many carbon emissions were "saved" by biking, walking, or jogging
a given amount of miles.

These emissions are stored, along with a point system, on an external save file. These points,
calulated from the emissions, are spendable in mini-game, in which the famed "green gecko"
avoids trash monsters and smog beasts and fights back with the power of recycling (thrown green shurikens).

Overall, the project, produced with Java, Github, MS Paint, and AutoDesk Sketchbook, was an enjoyable learning
experience.
We hope to do even better at the next Hackathon, but we can't believe what we accomplished today,
Thank you for reading.
